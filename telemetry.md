# Diagnose and monitor the backend services and Data-Accelerator's Data Processing components using ApplicationInsights
For diagnosing an issue, it is extremely useful to add telemetry via [ApplicationInsights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview#what-does-application-insights-monitor).
Currently, the backend services and DataAccelerator's DataProcessing component send ApplicationInsights telemetry.  
To access the logs, you can go to the portal.azure.com and open up the Applicationinsights instance--> click on Analytics  

Scenario:
In the Data Accelerator web UI if you are trying to [GetSchema](https://github.com/Microsoft/data-accelerator/wiki/Creating-your-first-pipeline-in-5-minutes!#steps-to-follow) generated. You can look at the ApplicationInsights logs and get details for this call in case you run into an error. You could go to ApplicationInsights resource on Azure portal and click on Analytics.
## Useful queries:
  ```
  exceptions
  | order by timestamp desc
  ```
  ```
  traces 
  | order by timestamp desc 
  | where operation_ParentId contains "datax-service" 
  | where operation_Name  contains "POST SchemaInference/GetInputSchema"
  ```

For DataX.Flow services You can filter additional telemetry in Startup.cs. This will require a redeployment of the services.
